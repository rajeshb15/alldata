# AllData® How to Use AllData APIs and Add Account Widget for Various Use Cases

May 2021


# Introduction

The purpose of this document is to advise Fiserv partners that plan to use the Add Account widget along with APIs to handle specific use cases.

## Overview

Before utilizing any of the following use cases, you must have a profile in the Fiserv system. The professional services team at Fiserv creates your administrative account and whitelists your IP address(es).

You will be assigned a unique partner ID and a home ID (or multiple home IDs, depending on your needs). You may provision multiple customers (users) under a home ID. A user may have more than one financial institution (&quot;FI&quot;) or any other accounts and connection types offered by AllData under their profile.

For all use cases outlined below, you must create a user profile using the CreateUser API. The user profile consists of the user ID, password, and several optional fields such as name and address. CreateUser returns a value called CEUserID which is the unique identifier for the end user.
