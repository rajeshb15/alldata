# Overview

This document describes the web services API usage of the Fiserv AllData application. A RESTful API web service handles communication between the partner application and Fiserv, using HTTP protocol over SSL/TLS as the communication medium.

To extract data from Fiserv, the partner application sends a request with certain partner-identifying parameters and user authentication tokens. Upon receipt, the Fiserv server performs the requested task and responds with the results.

The AllData application supports two data formats: XML and JSON. Please contact your AllData sales representative for a link to the updated JSON schema/sandbox testing environment for the web services.

The AllData system provides web service access to:

- add financial institution (&quot;FI&quot;) seed data
- add, delete, and manage users
- add, delete, and manage user accounts with the FIs
- harvest user account information daily and on demand
- retrieve various kinds of transactions to provide accurate and up-to-date information about user assets and holdings

## Scope and Target Audience

The purpose of this document is to provide information to partner architects, developers, and project/product managers to enable them make design decisions to connect to AllData web services.

The scope of this document is limited to AllData web services. Aspects of AllData services that include APIs are mentioned in the context of web services integration. Detailed information on other AllData PFM (personal finance manager) features such as UI portal, widgets, and batch file integrations for host account management are available in separate documents.
